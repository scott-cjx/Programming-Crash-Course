# What is Programming?

Programming is the process of writing code to solve problems. <br>
Below is a simple flowchart to show how code may be converted into program.

``` mermaid
graph LR
  A[Start]
  B["Type a code in"]
  C["Converted to binary (0/1)"]
  D["Syntax Error"]
  E["CPU processes them, giving output"]
  A --> B
  B -- Valid Code ---> C --> E
  B -- Invalid Code --> D
```

# Why do we program?

Programming gives convenience to our everyday lives. <br>
With code, transportation, banking and food delivery applications are made possible.

# Logic

Programming is relatively easy, once you pick up the basics.
